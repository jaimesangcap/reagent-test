Just a test to see if things work with reagent, turns out they do.

`lein figwheel` and start tweaking `src/reagent_test/core.cljs`

Basically all files created by `lein new reagent-frontend reagent-test`.

Only added the required dependencies to the `project.clj`.

Turns out I kind of depend on Clojure 1.9 which isn't really required though, will fix that.

Also looking at how to make the hiccup part optional as it should not be required for frontend things.
